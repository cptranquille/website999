      <description>Climate change and temperature anomaliesWe are going to study climate change and temperature anomalies. We get data of Combined Land-Surface Air and Sea-Surface Water Temperature Anomalies in the Northern Hemisphere at NASA’s Goddard Institute for Space Studies, and the tabular data of temperature anomalies
Data initialization and manipulationweather &amp;lt;- read_csv(&amp;quot;https://data.giss.nasa.gov/gistemp/tabledata_v3/NH.Ts+dSST.csv&amp;quot;, skip = 1, na = &amp;quot;***&amp;quot;)For each month and year, the dataframe shows the deviation of temperature from the normal (expected).</description>

      <description>Every so often, we hear warnings from commentators on the “inverted yield curve” and its predictive power with respect to recessions.

In addition, many articles and commentators think that, e.g., Yield curve inversion is viewed as a harbinger of recession.</description>

      <description>Every two years, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention conduct the Youth Risk Behavior Surveillance System (YRBSS) survey, where it takes data from high schoolers (9th through 12th grade), to analyze health patterns. We will work with a selected group of variables from a random sample of observations during one of the years the YRBSS was conducted.
Loading the dataThis data is part of the openintro textbook and we can load and inspect it.</description>
