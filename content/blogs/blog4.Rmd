# Climate change and temperature anomalies 

We are going to study climate change and temperature anomalies. We get data of *Combined Land-Surface Air and Sea-Surface Water Temperature Anomalies* in the Northern Hemisphere at [NASA's Goddard Institute for Space Studies](https://data.giss.nasa.gov/gistemp), and the [tabular data of temperature anomalies](https://data.giss.nasa.gov/gistemp/tabledata_v3/NH.Ts+dSST.txt)


## Data initialization and manipulation


```{r weather_data, cache=TRUE}

weather <- 
  read_csv("https://data.giss.nasa.gov/gistemp/tabledata_v3/NH.Ts+dSST.csv", 
           skip = 1, 
           na = "***")

```



For each month and year, the dataframe shows the deviation of temperature from the normal (expected). Further the dataframe is in wide format. 

We first select the year and the twelve month variables from the `weather` dataset and delete other variables.
```{r tidyweather}
tidyweather <- weather %>%
  select(Year:Dec) %>%
  pivot_longer(
    cols=Jan:Dec,
    names_to="Month",
    values_to="delta"
  )

tidyweather
```

## Plotting information

We first create a new variable called `data` to ensure that the `delta` values are plot chronologically. Then we plot the data using a time-series scatter plot, and add a trendline.
```{r scatter_plot}

tidyweather <- tidyweather %>%
  mutate(date = ymd(paste(as.character(Year), Month, "1")),
         month = month(date, label=TRUE),
         year = year(date))

ggplot(tidyweather, aes(x=date, y = delta))+
  geom_point()+
  geom_smooth(color="red") +
  theme_bw() +
  labs (
    title = "Weather anomalies are becoming more and more significant",
    y="Deviation of temperature from normal",
    x="Date"
  )

```


Moreover, to find our whether the effect of increasing temperature is more pronounced in some months, we use `facet_wrap()` to produce a seperate scatter plot for each month, again with a smoothing line.

```{r facet_wrap}

# To make sure months are in correct order
tidyweather$Month <- factor(tidyweather$Month,levels=c("Jan","Feb","Mar","Apr","May","Jun","Jul","Aug","Sep","Oct","Nov","Dec"))

ggplot(tidyweather,aes(x=date,y=delta))+
  geom_point()+
  geom_smooth(color="red")+
  facet_wrap("Month")+
  theme_bw() +
  labs (
    title = "Weather anomalies have similar patterns in different months",
    x="Data",
    y="Deviation of temperature from normal"
  )

```

It is sometimes useful to group data into different time periods to study historical data. For example, we often refer to decades such as 1970s, 1980s, 1990s etc. to refer to a period of time. NASA calculates a temperature anomaly, as difference form the base period of 1951-1980. The code below creates a new data frame called `comparison` that groups data in five time periods: 1881-1920, 1921-1950, 1951-1980, 1981-2010 and 2011-present.

We remove data before 1800 and before using `filter`. Then, we use the `mutate` function to create a new variable `interval` which contains information on which period each observation belongs to. We can assign the different periods using `case_when()`.

```{r intervals}

comparison <- tidyweather %>% 
  filter(Year>= 1881) %>%     #remove years prior to 1881
  #create new variable 'interval', and assign values based on criteria below:
  mutate(interval = case_when(
    Year %in% c(1881:1920) ~ "1881-1920",
    Year %in% c(1921:1950) ~ "1921-1950",
    Year %in% c(1951:1980) ~ "1951-1980",
    Year %in% c(1981:2010) ~ "1981-2010",
    TRUE ~ "2011-present"
  ))

```

Now that we have the `interval` variable, we can create a density plot to study the distribution of monthly deviations (`delta`), grouped by the different time periods we are interested in. We set `fill` to `interval` to group and colour the data by different time periods.

```{r density_plot}

ggplot(comparison, aes(x=delta, fill=interval))+
  geom_density(alpha=0.2) +   #density plot with tranparency set to 20%
  theme_bw() +                #theme
  labs (
    title="Density Plot for Monthly Temperature Anomalies",
    y="Density", 
    x="Deviation of temperature from normal"
  )

```

So far, we have been working with monthly anomalies. However, we might be interested in average annual anomalies. We do this by using `group_by()` and `summarise()`, followed by a scatter plot to display the result. 

```{r averaging}

#creating yearly averages
average_annual_anomaly <- tidyweather %>% 
  group_by(Year) %>%   #grouping data by Year
  
  # creating summaries for mean delta 
  # use `na.rm=TRUE` to eliminate NA (not available) values 
  summarise(annual_average_delta = mean(delta, na.rm=TRUE)) 

#plotting the data:
ggplot(average_annual_anomaly, aes(x=Year, y= annual_average_delta))+
  geom_point()+
  
  #Fit the best fit line, using LOESS method
  geom_smooth() +
  
  #change to theme_bw() to have white background + black frame around plot
  theme_bw() +
  labs (
    title = "Average Yearly Anomaly",
    y     = "Average Annual Delta"
  )                         


```



## Confidence interval for `delta`

[NASA points out on their website](https://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/world-of-change/decadaltemp.php) that 

> A one-degree global change is significant because it takes a vast amount of heat to warm all the oceans, atmosphere, and land by that much. In the past, a one- to two-degree drop was all it took to plunge the Earth into the Little Ice Age.

We construct a confidence interval for the average annual delta since 2011, both using a formula and using a bootstrap simulation with the `infer` package.

```{r, calculate_CI_using_formula}

# Using formula to calculate CI

formula_ci <- comparison %>% 
  filter(interval=="2011-present") %>%
  summarise(mean=mean(delta,na.rm=TRUE),std_dev=sd(delta,na.rm=TRUE),count=n(),se=std_dev/sqrt(count),CI_95=mean+1.96*se,CI_5=mean-1.96*se)
  
formula_ci
```

```{r, calculate_CI_using_bootstrap}

# use the infer package to construct a 95% CI for delta

set.seed(1234)

boot_delta <- comparison %>%
  filter(interval=="2011-present") %>%
  specify(response=delta) %>%
  generate(reps=1000,type="bootstrap") %>%
  calculate(stat="mean")

percentile_ci <- boot_delta %>%
  get_confidence_interval(level=0.95,type="percentile")

percentile_ci

```

Weather anomalies over the course of the last 140 years have been gradually increasing (relative to 1951-1980) & have begun to increase at an almost exponential rate since approximately 1963. This can be explained by the fact that the Earth is gradually getting warmer. Our confidence interval confirms this theory. To interpret: we are 95% sure that the average temperature deviation from normal from 2011-present is between 0.92-1.02.
